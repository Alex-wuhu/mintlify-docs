# Solidity Functions

Functions in Solidity have various access levels, attributes, and special behaviors.

## Function Access Levels

- **private**: Only in this contract
- **internal**: In this contract with inheritance
- **public**: Inside and outside this contract
- **external**: Only outside this contract

## Function Attributes

- **payable**: Can receive ether
- **pure**: Read-only, can't read/write blockchain data (completely independent)
- **view**: Read-only, can read blockchain data

```solidity
function add(uint x, uint y) external pure returns (uint) {
    return x + y;
}

function example() internal view { }
```

## Function Modifiers

Modifiers wrap functions and can take input. They don't have constructors:

```solidity
modifier whenNotPaused() {
    require(!paused, "paused");
    _;
}

function inc() external whenNotPaused {
    count += 1;
}

function dec() external whenNotPaused {
    count -= 1;
}

modifier cap(uint i) { 
    // ..code
}

function incBy(uint x) external whenNotPaused cap(x) {
    // code
}
```

Modifiers can also be used to create "sandwich" code:

```solidity
modifier sandwich() {
    count += 10;
    _;
    count *= 2;
}
```

## Special Functions

### Constructor

Only called once when we deploy the contract:

```solidity
contract ConstructorTest {
    address public owner;
    uint public x;
    
    constructor(uint _x) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        x = _x;
    }
}
```

### Receive

Executed when a contract is sent ether without any calldata, or when the calldata does not match a function signature:

```solidity
receive() external payable { }
```

A receive function has no name, takes no parameters, and returns nothing. It must be marked as external and payable.

### Fallback

Executed when:
- Caller tries to call a function that doesn't exist
- Ether is sent and receive function doesn't exist
- Ether is sent, receive function exists, but msg.data is not empty

```solidity
fallback() external { }
```

### Self-Destruct

When a contract lacks receive and fallback functions, it cannot receive Ether:

```solidity
function anyoneCanDestroy() public {
    // receiver needs to be address payable
    selfdestruct(receiver);
}
```

## Function Selector

All function calls are identified by function selectors in Solidity. These are the first 4 bytes of the hash of a function signature:

```solidity
function myFunction(address a, uint b, bytes c) public {...}

bytes4 selector = bytes4(keccak256("myFunction(address,uint256,bytes)"));
bytes4 selector = myFunction.selector;
```

## Function Outputs

Assigned return values save more gas:

```solidity
function returnMany() public pure returns (uint, bool) {
    return (1, true);
}

function named() public pure returns (uint x, bool b) {
    return (1, true);
}

function assigned() public pure returns (uint x, bool b) {
    x = 1;
    b = true;
}

function destruct() public pure {
    (uint x, bool b) = returnMany();
    (, bool b) = returnMany(); // ignore first value
}
```
