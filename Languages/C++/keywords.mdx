# C++ Keywords

## Storage Class Specifiers

### volatile
Declaring objects in **shared memory** that can be accessed by multiple processes. The compiler **reloads the value from memory** each time it is accessed by the program.

### const
Specifies that the object or variable isn't modifiable.

### constexpr (C++11)
It is possible to evaluate the value of the function or variable at compile time.

### extern
External linkage

### static
Internal linkage

### thread_local
Specifier is accessible only on the thread on which it's created.

```cpp
struct S // cannot be applied to type definition
{
    thread_local int i; // Illegal. The member must be static.
    thread_local static char buf[10]; // OK
};
```

## Type Deduction and Storage

### auto
Before it declares a variable in automatic storage class local lifetime. Now it declares a variable whose type is deduced from initialization expression.

### register
Register variable, requests the compiler to store this variable in the CPU register to speed up program execution (no longer supported).

## Function Calling Conventions

### __fastcall
Calling convention specifies that arguments to functions are to be passed in registers, only applies to the x86 architecture.

```cpp
struct CMyClass {
   void __fastcall mymethod();
};
// equivalent
void CMyClass::mymethod() { return; }
void __fastcall CMyClass::mymethod() { return; }
```

## Increment Operators

### a++ and ++a

```cpp
a = 1
b = a++  //b=1
c = ++a  //c = 2 
```
